# 🍕 Slice-Router

A modern, full-featured pizza ordering app built with **React**, **Redux Toolkit (RTK)**, and **React Router v6**. Styled with **Tailwind CSS** and powered by **Vite** for lightning-fast development.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Modern React** (v18+) with functional components and hooks.
- **Redux Toolkit (RTK)** for state management, using:
  - Multiple feature slices (`cart`, `user`) for modular state.
  - Advanced patterns like `createAsyncThunk` for async logic (e.g., geolocation and address fetching).
  - Selectors for efficient state access.
- **React Router v6** for routing, navigation, and data loading:
  - Uses route loaders and actions for data fetching and mutations.
  - No external data-fetching libraries (like React Query or SWR) are used—**all data fetching is handled via React Router loaders/actions and native `fetch`**.
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first, responsive, and modern UI.
- **Vite** for instant hot module reloads and fast builds.
- **ESLint** and **Prettier** (with Tailwind plugin) for code quality and formatting.

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

### State Management with RTK

- **Slices**: The app uses multiple RTK slices (`cartSlice`, `userSlice`) for modular state management.
- **Async Thunks**: For example, `userSlice` uses `createAsyncThunk` to fetch the user's geolocation and resolve their address asynchronously.
- **Selectors**: Custom selectors are used for derived state (e.g., total cart price, quantity).

### Routing and Data Loading

- **React Router v6** is used for all navigation and data loading.
- **Loaders and Actions**: Data fetching (menu, order details) and mutations (creating orders) are handled via route loaders and actions, not via external libraries.
- **No React Query/SWR**: All data fetching is done with native `fetch` and React Router's built-in mechanisms.

### UI and Styling

- **Tailwind CSS**: All components are styled using Tailwind for a modern, responsive look.
- **Reusable Components**: Buttons, loaders, and layout components are shared across features.

### Tooling

- **Vite**: For fast development and builds.
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Enforced code style and best practices.

## 📝 Highlights

- **RTK with Modern Patterns**: Uses `createSlice`, `createAsyncThunk`, and selectors for robust, scalable state management.
- **React Router Data APIs**: All data fetching and mutations are handled via React Router's loaders and actions—no need for extra libraries.
- **No External Data Fetching Libraries**: Simplicity and performance by relying on native `fetch` and React Router.
- **Clean, Modular Codebase**: Each feature is isolated, making the codebase easy to navigate and extend.
- **Beautiful UI**: Tailwind CSS ensures a consistent, modern look.

## 📂 Example Code Snippets

**RTK Async Thunk for Geolocation:**
```js
export const fetchAddress = createAsyncThunk(
  'user/fetchAddress',
  async function () {
    // Get geolocation and resolve address
  }
);
```

**React Router Loader for Data Fetching:**
```js
export async function loader() {
  const menu = await getMenu();
  return menu;
}
```

**No React Query/SWR:**
- All data fetching is done with `fetch` inside loaders/actions or thunks.

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a modern, idiomatic React architecture with Redux Toolkit and React Router, focusing on simplicity, performance, and best practices—**without relying on external data-fetching libraries**.
